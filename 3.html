									<h2>STRIDE MODEL</h2>
									The STRIDE was initially created as part of the process of 
									threat modeling. STRIDE is a model of threats, used to help reason 
									and find threats to a system. It is used in conjunction with a model 
									of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes 
									a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows, and trust boundaries.

									<h2>DREAD MODEL</h2>
										<p>
										DREAD is part of a system for risk-assessing computer 
										security threats that was formerly used at Microsoft. It 
										provides a mnemonic for risk rating security threats using five 
										categories. 
										</p>
										<p>
										The DREAD name comes from the initials of the five categories 
										listed. It was initially proposed for threat modeling but was 
										abandoned when it was discovered that the ratings are not very 
										consistent and are subject to debate. It was discontinued at Microsoft by 2008.
										</p>
										<p>
										When a given threat is assessed using DREAD, each category is 
										given a rating from 1 to 10.[3] The sum of all ratings for a 
										given issue can be used to prioritize among different issues.</p><b>
