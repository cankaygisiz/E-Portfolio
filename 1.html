									<h2>What is it and why is it important?</h2>
										<p>What is the CIA Triad in Cyber Security?  
										The CIA security triad model is constructed close to the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
									 	information are essential to the function of the business, and the CIA triad splits these three concepts into individual 
									 	focal points. This differentiation is advantageous because it enables security teams to determine diverse methods by which 
									 	they can address each problem. Ideally, when all three benchmarks are satisfied,
									 	the organization's security shape is more assertive and better qualified to handle threat incidents.</p> 
									
										<p>Like other unfortunate acronyms out there, one of them is the WTF (World Trade Federation), but the CIA can often mean something else.
										 It does refer to the Central Intelligence Agency. But when it comes to cybersecurity, it signifies something positively different.</p>
									
										<p>In cybersecurity, the CIA refers to the CIA Triad in Cyber Security, a vision that concentrates on the balance between the confidentiality, 
										integrity, and availability of data under the protection of your information security structure. The objective of the triad is to help institutions 
										construct their security strategy and develop policies and controls while also conforming as a foundational starting point for any unknown use cases, 
										products, and technologies.

									<h2>Cyber Security Professionals</h2>
									<p>
										An authority in the field of information technology security is a 
										cyber security specialist. They work to protect users while software is being developed. 
										Their task is to ensure that networks are protected from outside 
										dangers such as malevolent hackers or crackers who attempt to gain 
										unauthorized access.

									<h2>Ethical and legal responsibilities</h2>
										<p>								
										Computer science experts must use caution and respect 
										others' right to privacy in these circumstances. 
										For example, it is unethical for a computer science expert 
										to take content off of someone else's hard disk and utilize 
										it for their own purposes.
